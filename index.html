                <p>It is the process of getting traffic from the “free” or “natural” search results on search engines. It is also the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.</p>

                <p class="tm-text tm-margin-b-0">
                  Notice that when you use your mouse to point at a particular search result, called aresult block, a small, sideways chevron appears next to it (). Clicking on that chevron allows you to preview a document, letting you determine what kind of document is behind the link. It can help you decide whether that link meets your needs, and whether you want to visit the page.These previews, in combination with skimming results, can help you get a quick grounding in a subject.
                </p>
                <h5 class="header col s12 light"><b>2. Understanding an individual search result</b></h5>
                <p class="tm-text tm-margin-b-0">
                Result blocks on a search results page consist of three major elements:</p>
                <p class="tm-text tm-margin-b-0"><u>Title</u>: The blue link in the top line gives you the topic of the page.</p>
                <p class="tm-text tm-margin-b-0"><u>Web address/URL</u>: The second line contains a green link which tells you location of the document on the web. This line can help you determine the source of the information.</p>
                <p class="tm-text tm-margin-b-0"><u>Snippet</u>: This last two lines, the black text, show you some of the places where your search terms appear on the page, embedded in the text in which they appear. A snippet is not a complete summary of the text on a page; it is only search terms in context, extracted from the document.</p>
                
                <h5 class="header col s12 light"><b>3. Using an entire results page</b></h5>
                <p class="tm-text tm-margin-b-0">Not only is it helpful to know how to understand a single result, but you can gain a lot from taking a moment to look over an entire screen or page full of results.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Set realistic goals</h5>

            <p class="light">A myriad of elements affect position with the search engines, and moving toward those top listings takes time and effort. You understand this, but do your stakeholders? Although SEO is an effective long-term investment, its results are not instantaneous like those of PPC. Setting realistic expectations out of the gate about how search engines work and the types of results you can realistically expect to achieve will do wonders in shaping perception.
            <br><br>
            Ask your SEO partner to provide detail that you can easily pass on to your stakeholders to help them understand the ins and outs.
            You know that you can’t just “move” your organic listing to page one. Make sure the person who approves your budget understands that as well.<br></p>

            <h5 class="center">Pulling it together</h5>

            <p class="light">
                  The longevity of your SEO Campaign is based on a multitude of factors that are typically rolled up into two outcomes – success or failure. Setting realistic goals, measuring your performance towards those goals over time and identifying conversion points all help paint an accurate picture of your SEO campaign.
                  <br><br>
                  Setting and managing expectations – your own as well as those of your stakeholders – will work wonders as you move through your SEO Program and prove your value.

            <h5 class="center">Set a baseline</h5>

            <p class="light">One element of measuring success in any SEO campaign is time. Now that you’ve established your Calls to Action and identified all conversion points along the way, setting a baseline to measure progress over time couldn’t be more important.
            <br><br>
            Remember that search engines need some time to index your newly revamped web pages. Month to month comparisons tend to provide more realistic insight than day to day dips and spikes. Although daily changes can be interesting (and even slightly addictive) to note, be cautious in your reactions. Stay true to your SEO plan to understand the month to month implications of your SEO efforts. Don’t pull the plug on a well-thought SEO plan if you noticed a slight dip yesterday in the SERPs after you changed your heading tags</p>
